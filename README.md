## Introduction

IMERIR is an engineering school providing training in IT, connected objects, artificial intelligence, maker culture and robotics. By the way, here is its logo:

This school has a humanoid robot known as Pepper. Initially manufactured and marketed by the French company Aldebaran robotics, the production and marketing of Pepper was taken over by the Japanese company Softbank when the latter acquired Aldebaran robotics. Here is an image of this robot so emblematic of humanoid robotics:

## How to install this app-launcher on the Pepper robot ?

In this section, we will install this project (the customized IMERIR app-launcher) on the Pepper robot of IMERIR. Please follow the instructions below carefully in order:

1. To start, you need to clone the Git repository of the “app-launcher” project hosted on GitHub, using the “git clone https://github.com/Vicken-Ghoubiguian/app-launcher ” command as shown below.

2. Now please position yourself in the newly created "app-launcher" directory using the "cd app-launcher" command as shown in the screenshot below:

3. Please open the Choregraphe software, the Pepper robot development and administration software developed by Softbank robotics. On Microsoft's Windows platform, you can either click on the software icon in the taskbar (for example) as shown below:
<img src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_3.PNG" data-canonical-src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_3.PNG" width="1000" height="30" align="center" />

If you haven't installed the Choregraphe software, you can do so by downloading the installer from the official Softbank robotics website (at this link:https://www.softbankrobotics.com/emea/en/support/pepper-naoqi-2-9/downloads-softwares) as shown in the screenshot below:
<img src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_4.PNG" data-canonical-src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_4.PNG" width="1902" height="965" align="center" />

__Warning__: the version of the Choregraphe software that you download and therefore that you wish to install must correspond to the version of the NAOqi operating system installed on your robot. For example if your robot works under version 2.5.10 of the NAOqi operating system, then you must download and install version 2.5.10 of the Choregraphe software.

The Choregraphe software installer is then downloaded to your computer. Now you need to run it to install the software. This is illustrated by the screenshot below:
<img src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_5.PNG" data-canonical-src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_5.PNG" width="700" height="150" align="center" />

Now that the Choregraphe software is open on your computer, the following window opens as shown below:
<img src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_7.PNG" data-canonical-src="./images_to_display_in_github_repos/installation_procedure_images/procedure_7.PNG" width="1900" height="300" align="center" />

Now is the time to move on.
